Bug reports or suggested documentation updates are very welcome - please raise an issue (see below).

Enhancement requests are also welcome, but please bear in mind that this package is intended to be as lightweight as possible - for more fully fledged handling of OGC GeoPackages you might want to consider the [NGA GeoPackage Libraries](https://github.com/ngageoint/GeoPackage#geopackage).

2. Which browser(s) show the problem?
3. What versions of OpenLayers and sql.js are you using?
4. What did you do?
