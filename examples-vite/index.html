        <h4>ol-load-geopackage examples (Vite build)</h4>
        <p>Each example is presented as HTML/JavaScript source code and a
            directly viewable web page (with production-optimized JavaScript
            built using Vite).</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic Example: <a href="basic_example.html">web page</a>
                (sources: <a href="https://github.com/richard-thomas/ol-load-geopackage/tree/master/examples-vite/basic_example.html">HTML</a>,
                <a href="https://github.com/richard-thomas/ol-load-geopackage/tree/master/examples-vite/src/basic_example.js">JavaScript</a>)</li>
            <p>Loads vector tables and associated QGIS "layer_styles" SLD XML
                strings from an OGC GeoPackage and render all tables as layers
                on an OpenLayers map. Displays details of package contents.</p>
            <li>Proj4 Example: <a href="proj4_example.html">web page</a>
            (sources: <a href="https://github.com/richard-thomas/ol-load-geopackage/tree/master/examples-vite/proj4_example.html">HTML</a>,
            <a href="https://github.com/richard-thomas/ol-load-geopackage/tree/master/examples-vite/src/proj4_example.js">JavaScript</a>)</li>
            <p>Used in conjunction with Proj4js module to enable additional
                projections to those built in to OpenLayers. These other
                projections can be for the input source data and/or the output
                display projection. Also demonstrates loading required sql.js
                WASM from an external Content Delivery Network (CDN) site.</p>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <p>You can try the examples with your own GeoPackage data (without
            having to install Node.js or Vite) by cloning the GitHub
            repository then editing the "gpkgFile" definition in the HTML files.
            In order to ensure all the files are able to load you will have to
            host them with a (simple) local HTTP server, for example by running
            in the examples-vite/dist folder...
        </p>
        <p>python -m http.server <i>(Windows)</i></p>
        <p>python3 -m http.server <i>(macOS/Linux)</i></p>
        <p>... which will allow you to view them in a browser at
            http://localhost:8000/.
            Note however that if your source data uses projections (SRS) other
            than the few built in to OpenLayers, then you would need to modify
            the .js source files (as in the Proj4 example) to add more SRS and
            rebuild the .js bundles.
